# Face Tracking Webcam Feed

This is a side project for me to learn and interact more with the mediapipe library as well as for me to learn more about openCV.

## Dependancies

- Python 3.9
- Opencv-python
- mediapipe
- numpy

## Installation Guide

```python

git clone https://github.com/AngKS/Mediapipe-Webcam-Face-Tracker.git
cd Mediapipe-Webcam-Face-Tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Further Implementations (Project Roadmap)

- Add a **Super Resolution GAN**/any **Upsampling algorithms** to enhance the webcam feed before passing the webcam capture into the mediapipe detection algorithm.
- Implement the entire pipeline onto a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and convert it into a Plug & Play Smart Webcam.
- Virtual Background using Image Segmentation(?)

## Contributions

If you wish to contribute towards this project (making my life a teeny less miserable), do consider forking this repo, help me out with the implementations and submit a pull request back to the repo. (All help are appreciated! :D)
